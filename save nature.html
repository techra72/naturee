        <h1 style="font-size:50px;color:red;text-align:center;">LET'S SAVE NATURE</h1>
        <P style="font-size:20px; color:navy; font-style: oblique;text-align:center;">>Human activities are the main villain that harms nature. Earlier, it was not evident the dangerous effects of human exploitation on nature. When we think that we have only cut down a single tree, which might not damage nature, remember that there would be hundreds of others who think like you. So, one tree becomes hundreds, thousands and millions. At this pace, nature will soon exhaust its resources, and we will be suffering from various natural disasters and diseases. To put it simply, our mere existence would be threatened.This is why we need to preserve nature.In this how to save nature essay, we explore a few ways to coexist with nature.</P><br>
